# Getting Started
## Dependencies
Tools needed to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`
Once you have these, install the following as globals:  
`npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli webpack`

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli webpack` install global cli dependencies
* `npm install` to install dependencies

## Running the App
NG6 uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `gulp` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.

### Gulp Tasks
Here's a list of available tasks:
* `webpack`
  * runs Webpack, which will transpile, concatenate, and compress (collectively, "bundle") all assets and modules into `dist/bundle.js`. It also prepares `index.html` to be used as application entry point, links assets and created dist version of our application.
* `serve`
  * starts a dev server via `webpack-dev-server`, serving the client folder.
* `watch`
  * alias of `serve`
* `default` (which is the default task that runs when typing `gulp` without providing an argument)
	* runs `serve`.
* `component`
  * scaffolds a new Angular component. [Read below](#generating-components) for usage details.
